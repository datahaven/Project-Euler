Project Euler 187
Semiprimes

I solved this one sometime between 2010 and 2011 but can't find any code for it.
I wonder if I cheated? It is very possible that I found the below information and
simply didn't bother to write any code.

Definition of a semiprime here:

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Semiprime.html
This page gives a formula for number of semi-primes less than or equal to n

It then helpfully points to OEIS for the sequence of numbers of semiprimes less than 10^n
for n=1, 2, ...

http://oeis.org/A066265

Pick out the one for n==8 and that's your answer!

I think the code is probably a pretty straightforward double-loop through all primes
less than 10^8, multiplying them together and counting them if they are less than 10^8
